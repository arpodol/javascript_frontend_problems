        <figcaption>The lantern fish lures other animals in with light
        and then eats them. Lanternfish use bioluminescence, a chemical
        reaction, to produce light. Lanternfish eat small copepods and shrimp.
        Most lanternfish migrate to the surface nightly to feed.</figcaption>

          order Charadriiformes. It is a common and widespread resident throughout
           South America, except in densely forested regions (e.g. most of the

          the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South
           America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored
           bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the
            species, making them aposematic.</figcaption>
